        <p><span style="color:#3586ff;">Wailord debuted</span> in Having a Wailord of a Time. The Float Whale Pokémon was stuck on a beach near a Pokémon Center. Team Rocket tried to haul it away, but a Combusken foiled their plans.</p>
     
            <div>In Island Time, a Wailord evolved from a Wailmer that befriended Robin in order to transport Ash and his friends across the ocean. The group disembarked when they came across a ship heading for Ever Grande City.</div> 
             
             <div>In Pokémon Ranger and the Temple of the Sea, Manaphy encountered multiple Wailord and rode atop one during the group's voyage to Samiya. Several later actively participated in the showdown between the Water</div>
              <div>Pokémon and the Phantom and his crew. One briefly reappeared in a montage in The Rise of Darkrai, which chronicled the preceding nine movies.</div>
